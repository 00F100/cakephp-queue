CakePHP Queue Plugin
--------------------------------

Installation:
--------------------------------
* Copy the files in this directory into <yourapp>/plugins/queue.
* Run the following command in the cake console to create the tables:
		cake schema run create -path plugins\queue\config\sql -name queue

Usage:
--------------------------------
  cake queue help
          -> Display Help message
  cake queue add <taskname>
          -> Try to call the cli add() function on a task
          -> tasks may or may not provide this functionality.
  cake queue runworker
          -> run a queue worker, which will look for a pending task it can execute.
          -> the worker will always try to find jobs matching its installed Tasks
Notes:
	<taskname> may either be the complete classname (eg. queue_example)
	or the shorthand without the leading "queue_" (eg. example)
        
Use 'cake queue help' to get a list of installed/available tasks.

Custom tasks should be placed in <yourapp>/vendors/shells/tasks.
Tasks should be named 'queue_something.php' and implement a "queueSomethingTask", keeping Cakephp Naming conventions intact.

A detailed Example task can be found in /vendors/shells/tasks/queue_example.php inside this folder.
